## Intro to Concourse

- Concourse is an Open Source Continuous Integration Tool. 
- It has a simple and yet very effective architecture:

   - Command-line interface called fly
   - A Server component that runs the web UI and the API called from the command-line. The Web UI is only used for displaying the state of the pipelines and for triggering pipelines manually. All other tasks are performed via the fly CLI.
   - Worker machines where pipelines run

Design Principles:

No snowflakes: there is no configuration of concourse server that we can apply on run-time, no gui, etc.
Usability in mind (with a single click you get what you need)
Isolated builds. There is no longer build pollution because everything runs in a container
Scalable. To add more capacity, we add more Worker machines.
No plugins but docker images. You bring your own docker image. You dont depend on pre-installed plugins.
We dont need to backup concourse. Instead we should find a way to simply redeploy our pipelines again.
Infrastructure agnostic (we can deploy it in AWS, vSphere, GCP, Azure, others)
